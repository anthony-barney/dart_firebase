## Firebase APIs for Dart

Generated Dart libraries for accessing
[Firebase APIs](https://firebase.google.com).

This is based on the [`googleapis.dart`](https://github.com/google/googleapis.dart) repository but instead aimed at supporting Firebase related APIs only. Additionally, this adds support for several unlisted (but discoverable) Firebase APIs that are not listed on the official [discovery API](https://discovery.googleapis.com/discovery/v1/apis) that `googleapis.dart` uses (and is currently limited to) as well as several private APIs (APIs that require an API key to view discovery information).
